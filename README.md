This is the repository for the Hyperdex group project of the 2020 Distributed Systems course at TU Delft.  
We implemented a subset of the Hyperdex system as specified in the 2012 paper (https://doi.org/10.1145/2342356.2342360).

## Implemented features

- Hyperspace hashing
- basic create, put, get, search API
- configurable amount of datanodes
- in-memory storage

## API
### Create
POST /create/"table_name" with attribute names as json list

### Lookup
GET /get/"table_name"/"key"

### Put
Post /put/"table_name"/"key" with value specified as json dictionary

### Search
GET /search/"table_name"/"key" with attributes values specified as json dictionary


## Run instructions

### locally with single datanode
in two terminals:

`sbt "runMain hyperdex.Main gateway 25251"`

`sbt "runMain hyperdex.Main data 25252"`


### Docker and `docker-compose`
First set the `NUM_DATANODES` environment variable:
- Powershell: `$env:NUM_DATANODES=X` (not persistent)
- Bash: `export NUM_DATANODES=X`
 
Then, run: 
- Powershell: `docker-compose up --build --scale datanode=$env:NUM_DATANODES`
- Bash: `docker-compose up --build --scale datanode=$NUM_DATANODES`

You can now GET/POST as described above.
NOTE: Don't forget that if you want to rebuild the images (because you might have changed something in the source code,
for example) you have to run `docker-compose` with the `--build` flag.

---
In the rare case you need it here are the commands to build and run the docker containers separately:

First build the container (mind the `.` at the end):
1. `docker build -t hyperdex:latest -f Dockerfile .`

Create a docker network: `docker network create --subnet=172.18.0.0/16 akka-network` \
_(make sure to remove the network again if you want to run docker-compose, otherwise it will overlap: `docker network rm akka-network` and possibly `docker network prune`)_

Then, in separate terminals, run:
1. `docker run --net=akka-network --ip 172.18.0.22 -p 8080:8080 -it hyperdex:latest java -jar hyperdex.jar gateway 25251 1`
2. `docker run --net=akka-network --ip 172.18.0.23 -it hyperdex:latest java -jar hyperdex.jar data 25252`


### Running gatling tests 
First start the `hyperdex` system as described above. Then, in another terminal, run `sbt gatling:test`. It will run the gatling test as described in the `GatlingTest` folder. The output (including html file) is written to `target/gatling/gatlingtest-*`
